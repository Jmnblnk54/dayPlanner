This day planner has input fields labeled from 9am to 5pm. When the user inputs the task to be scheduled and clicks the save button, the data is written to local storage so that when the page is refreshed, it does not reset the field. The date and time is at the top of the page and the hour is referenced for either past, present or future. Each of those are separate classes applied to the background color in the input field depending on if the present hour is before, after or during the current hour posted at the top. 

Languages used: HTML, CSS, Javascript
